            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Company is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          The program focuses on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. The curriculum offers comprehensive insights into these transformative technologies. An in depth understanding of Ethereum is given with an introduction to Solidity.
          To deepen my Comouter Science knowledge, I spent a semester abroad at James Cook University in Singapore, further expanding my horizon.
          Beyond technology, the program nurtured an innovative spirit, equipping graduates like myself with entrepreneurial skills for real-world impact.
